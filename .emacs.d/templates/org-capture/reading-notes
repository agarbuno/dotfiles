** What was the main technical hurdle faced by past work? How does this paper overcome it?

** What is the simplest nontrivial baseline? According to what metric is the new method better?

** Whatâ€™s still open and why does their insight not apply there?

** Does their insight apply to other unconsidered problems?

** What are the caveats and takeaways?

** How did they prove their lemmas, propositions, theorems?

** Can I reprove (in spirit) their result from scratch?

** If I cannot, what piece of intuition am I missing? Does an additional assumption make it easier?

** Can I simplify their proof using the tools I know, or prove their main result in a very different way, once I get their intuition?
